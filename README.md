# Rust in action

In this repository you will find information about the book
`Rust in Action` by [Tim McNamara](https://twitter.com/timClicks).

## Stucture
Each lecture's example will have its own executable
inside the `src/bin/` folder as well as a brief explanation
written with the RustDoc guidelines to follow along with
the code.

## How to run
To run one binary, you should run:

```terminal
cargo run --bin binary-name
```
